## Calculator

Calculator is a search query in itself, so its always right there 
when you need it. So you don't have to open anything up, just type whatever's in your mind and shundo should be able to handle it.

and by "whatever's in your mind" we mean litreally anything. So other than basic calculations, you can also do some advanced stuff like trigonometry, logarithms, etc.
you can do things like:

- 5ft in m
- 25usd to inr
